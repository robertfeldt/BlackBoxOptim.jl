#  R. Le Riche (2010). On Object-Oriented Programming of Optimizers -

#
# but since Julia is not OO this is more reflected in certain patterns of how
# to specify and call optimizers. The basic ask-and-tell pattern is:
#
#   while !optimizer.stop
#     x = ask(optimizer)
#     y = f(x)
#     optimizer = tell(optimizer, x, y)
#   end
#
# after which the best solutions can be found by:
#
#   yopt, xopt = best(optimizer)
#
# We have extended this paradigm with the use of an archive that saves
# information on what we have learnt about the search space as well as the
# best solutions found. For most multi-objective optimization problems there
# is no single optimum. Instead there are many pareto optimal solutions.
# An archive collects information about the pareto optimal set or some
# approximation of it. Different archival strategies can be implemented.
